When a patient first walks into the clinic, it is important for them to feel as comfortable as possible (just putting it out there, even though that’s obvious). No one comes to see the Dentist because they happened to be in the neighbourhood (everyone hates us). 8 in 10 times, they come because they are in pain.  

It is important to have empathy and understanding that it can be quite disconcerting for the patients to visit a Dental clinic for the first time. If you work at a practice with a consultation room (basically somewhere fancy :information_desk_person:), it is advisable to use it for the initial part of the first appointment to allow familiarity in surroundings. If you need to take them through to your clinic/surgery immediately, seat the patient at the table at the same level as you and not directly throw them into the dental chair.  

Good observation and attention to detail goes a long way for any medical practitioner (pretty much our bread and butter). Assess the patient’s mannerisms, their personality, gait, complexion, appearance, speech (but don’t gawk at them and make them feel scrutinized) [1]. Every little detail contributes to making a final diagnosis. If a patient doesn’t respond in a respectful manner, don’t jump to conclusions that this patient is going to be nervous during the procedure, or this patient is going to be problematic, it could be that their behaviour is owed to any pain or discomfort they may be in.  

Dentists are probably one of the most feared creatures on this planet (surprise, surprise!). Let’s play a fun little game and ask 10 people to choose between a dragon and a Dentist, they will probably pick the dragon (:broken_heart:). There’s still a possibility to sneak past the dragon and come out unharmed, but for sure the Dentist is going to poke and prod and traumatize them. Therefore, it is necessary to have a calm, composed and positive demeanour with the patient (even if they get on your last nerve).  

Medical history plays an important role not just for the patient but also for the Dentist. Taking the patient’s medical history is a mandatory step that just cannot be skipped. Ask the patient to either fill out a form or ask verbal questions and take copious notes (type stuff out if you write like a doctor!).  

While taking the medical history, make your own assessment on the ability of the patient to accept your diagnosis. Based on the Trans-theoretical model of Behaviour change (doesn’t necessarily have to be this model) [2], rank the patient in one of the 6 stages –  

- Pre-contemplation (Not ready) – unaware, uninformed, no intention to change 
- Contemplation (Getting ready) – aware problem exists, thinking about changing 
- Preparation (Ready) – intention to act and implement change 
- Action (Started to do) – make modification in their behaviour  
- Maintenance (Are keeping it up) – have made necessary modifications, prevent relapse 
- Termination (Doing it completely) – 100% self-efficacy achieved, no temptation to relapse 

Analysing a person’s mental state can help you determine the extent of their acceptance for your proposed treatment. Someone with a borderline personality disorder [3] may never be satisfied with the treatment you do for them. This is where knowing the dental history plays a major role. If a patient has undergone orthodontic or cosmetic treatment multiple times by multiple Dentists and are still unsatisfied, chances are that your suggested treatment may not satisfy them either (don’t take it personally).  

At the same time, don’t walk on eggshells around the patient, they are there for a reason and they know what they want, even if you feel it may not be possible (stay strong!). Ask open ended questions (eg. Could you describe your pain for me? instead of Do you have dull or sharp pain?) and let the patient lead the conversation. It is important to listen and try to understand their state of mind. 

It is not enough to look at a person and solely focus on their oral cavity. It is important to envision the being as a whole and have a holistic approach when determining the cause and developing a treatment strategy. Sometimes, treating a different aspect of someone’s life can lead you to help them achieve the outcome they always wanted. Recognizing a person in stress and nudging them to achieve better mental health can cure a myriad of diseases, some probably they never even knew they had. The more you treat the patient as a person and not as a case in your folder, the more people you end up helping and the more trust you gain.
