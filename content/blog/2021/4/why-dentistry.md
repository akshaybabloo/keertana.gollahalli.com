This is a question most of us are asked during college interviews or by friends and family. Before asking anyone else, ask yourself this, why dentistry?

Even though we live in a time where most of us know what it is, letâ€™s still humour ourselves and understand what dentistry actually is.

It is not just all about fillings and extractions. Dentistry is a science which deals with the prevention, treatment and maintenance of not just your teeth but all the soft and hard structures surrounding it. It involves a study of how to diagnose, treat and prevent any conditions, disorders or diseases of the teeth, gums, mouth and jaw. (allseasonsdentalkent.com/)

Like any other branch of Medicine, it is rapidly progressing. Dentists are often the first health care professionals to recognize and identify a number of medical conditions including blood disorders, diabetes, hypertension, liver disorders, even cancer. They use a large range of new and advanced technology right from digital scanning to complex screening equipment.

As a dentist, you not only treat oral health but also educate the community at large about the importance of regular oral check ups. You make a difference to every individual not just in terms of relieving pain but also providing them with that extra confidence.

If you have an artistic vision and a decent understanding of the human body, pick dentistry. If you have a passion for technology and research, pick dentistry. If you have an empathetic and patient yet vibrant and positive personality, pick dentistry. If you want to be in the front lines to benefit the society and make a difference, pick dentistry!
