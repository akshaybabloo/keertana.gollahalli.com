# About

Hi! My name is Dr Keertana and I am a Dentist. I know, eww right? Who likes to stare into someone’s mouth for a living? But that is what I would like to address on my page. Everything Dentistry! From the why’s and how’s to the what’s and if’s.  

I am currently working as a Surgical Assistant (licensing exams take up your life and suck out your soul) with Periodontal surgeons (woah!) and also going through the process of getting my license (surprise, surprise) as a General Dentist in Auckland, New Zealand. I was born in India and spent more than 2 decades in the United Arab Emirates. I graduated as a Doctor of Dental Medicine (DMD) from the College of Dentistry, Gulf Medical University, Ajman, U.A.E.

I am a very passionate and talkative person, through and through Potterhead. My hobbies include reading (a LOT), writing, binging Harry Potter and Friends, dancing and Dentistry. 

When I first entered the field of Dentistry, I was baffled by the concept of having to study 32 teeth for 5 years and then some! I started with a thousand questions and 8 years later, I have a thousand more. With this page, I hope to address some of those questions and help my fellow budding Dentists.
